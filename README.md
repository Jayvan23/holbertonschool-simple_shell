# _shell
Write a script that implements a basic shell interpreter.

# Description
\_shell is a simple custom implementation of a shell interpreter. It aims to replicate the functionality of a basic command
line shell, capable of executing commands, handling arguments, and providing features such as piping, redirection, and
background execution. This shell supports handling basic Unix/Linux commands and enables interaction with the operating
system's command-line interface.

# Usage
To use the \_shell, open a terminal and run the script as follows: $ ./_shell
This will start an interactive shell where you can type commands. The shell will execute commands in the current
environment and handle any arguments or special syntax.

# Features
\_shell supports the following features:

simple_shell

The shell starts and displays the prompt
hsh
Start the simple shell by invoking 'hsh'
ls
Output the list of files in the current directory:
AUTHORS          README.md        hsh
main.c           man_1_simple_shell shell.c
shell.h          shellbuiltsin.c  shellhelpers.c
exit
Exits the shell
