NAME
       simple_shell - a simple UNIX command-line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
       simple_shell is a basic UNIX command-line interpreter that prompts the user to enter
       a command. It waits for user input, executes the command, and then displays the prompt again.
       The command line consists of a single word (no arguments), and no advanced features like
       semicolons, pipes, or redirection are supported. If a command cannot be found, an error message
       is displayed, and the prompt is shown again.

       The shell handles errors and the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D) gracefully. If the user presses
       Ctrl+D, the shell exits.

COMMANDS
       The shell executes commands entered by the user. Each command must be a single word with no arguments.
       If an executable is not found, an error message is shown.

EXAMPLES
       $ simple_shell
       # The shell starts and displays the prompt
       $ hsh
       # Start the simple shell by invoking 'hsh'
       $ ls
       # Output the list of files in the current directory:

       $ exit
       # Exits the shell

EXIT STATUS
       0   Successful execution.
       1   Command not found or execution failed.
